### Project description

For this project, the task is to train an agent to navigate in a large, square world, while collecting yellow bananas, and avoiding blue bananas. A reward of `+1` is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of `-1` is provided for collecting a blue banana. Thus, the goal is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.

- **State space** is `37` dimensional and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around the agent's forward direction. 

- **Action space** is `4` dimentional. Four discrete actions correspond to:
  - `0` - move forward
  - `1` - move backward
  - `2` - move left
  - `3` - move right

- **Solution criteria**: the environment is considered as solved when the agent gets an average score of **+13 over 100 consecutive episodes**.
